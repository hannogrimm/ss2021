# Guided DataCamp Project: GARCH Models in Python
I really enjoyed this project! This was a great foundation on the complex implications of time-series data such as stocks. I have learned a lot about the different forecasting models (GARCH, ARIMA) and more advanced approaches to determine risk and reward based on these. I have found myself very motivated to learn more about Applied Finances.

### Project Notebook
I copied most practical tasks of the DataCamp into a notebook. This also served as my document for notes. I took my notes in explaining the context and details of the tasks. As a bonus, I learned a lot about writing equations in Markdown. :)

This document is deprecated. It features a few notes, but these are also mostly featured in the project notebook. For the sake of completeness, it is still featured here.
