# Courses
These courses helped me to build a great foundation on `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and more packages from the Data Science ecosystem. 

Not all courses I have undertaken are featured in this repository. This is mainly due to the fact that I have found it more useful to apply the learnings in practice rather than taking a copy of them into a notebook and adding my notes. For Data Manipulation with `pandas`, it was important for me to write down some self-written notes based on it's foundations. 

An overview of my courses taken on DataCamp:
* **[(100%) Data Manipulation with `pandas`**](datacamp--data-manipulation-with-pandas/README.md)**
* (100%) Introduction to Financial Concepts in Python
* **[(100%) GARCH Models in Python](datacamp--garch-models/README.md))**
* (75%) Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in Python
* (40%) Introduction to Risk Management in Python
* (30%) Intermediate Data Visualization with seaborn
