# Courses
These courses helped me to build a great foundation on `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and more packages from the Data Science ecosystem. 

For my education, I found DataCamp to be a great fit for this need, as the courses introduce theory and practice together. For the finance-focused courses, I used video material on YouTube to research open questions, e.g. mathematical functions for financial factors, that were left unexplained in the courses. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/) was also a great resource to re-visit terminologies and learn more around the scope.

I decided to do one pure Data Science course (Data Manipulation with Pandas). I then chose one additional course to guide me into the foundations of financial analysis which simulanteously explored more data visualization with _matplotlib_ or _seaborn_. (Introduction to Financial Concepts in Python).

Not all courses I have undertaken are featured in this repository. This is mainly due to the fact that I have found it more useful to apply the learnings in practice rather than taking a copy of them into a notebook and adding my notes. For Data Manipulation with `pandas`, it was important for me to write down some self-written notes based on it's foundations. 

An overview of my courses taken on DataCamp:
* **[(100%) Data Manipulation with `pandas`](datacamp--data-manipulation-with-pandas/README.md)**
* (100%) Introduction to Financial Concepts in Python
* **[(100%) GARCH Models in Python](datacamp--garch-models/README.md)**
* (75%) Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in Python
* (40%) Introduction to Risk Management in Python
* (30%) Intermediate Data Visualization with seaborn
