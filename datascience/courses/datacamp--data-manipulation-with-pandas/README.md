# Guided DataCamp Project: Data Manipulation with `pandas`
This project served as a great introduction to the functions of `seaborn` and `pandas`. Before I started this module, I had no experience with the benefits and quirks of Python. After finishing this DataCamp project, I felt quite comfortable about working with DataFrames, especially indexes and slices, visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### Project Notebook
At the start of the course, I practiced copying the practical tasks of the DataCamp into a notebook. I didn't find this very helpful, so I quit this practice rather early.

### Notes
This document is a partial notes-page off my relevant learnings about DataFrames. Similar to the project notebook, I have quit this practice in the middle of the course. I have found it more beneficial to apply it directly in my projects with trial and error.
