Self-Directed Learning for Stock Market Analysis (Solo)

## Goals and Achievement
The requirement for completed projects for the module assessment was at first something I had to accustome myself to, as for most of my assessments where directly covered by my project work. I therefore had to take my time and reflect to ask myself the questions: What do I expect to learn from them? How can I find the best fit of projects to aid me in my project scope whiile simultaneously achieve the necessary foundations of Data Science? Does my project feature the right scope to learn "proper" Data Science?

I concluded two things for myself: I want to learn and practice foundations of financial analysis, i.e. risk management, portfolio analysis, time-series plotting. Meanwhile, I set am emphasis on the necessity to undergo one common Data Science Beginner path so I do not miss out foundations of Data Science in my "finance bubble", as this domain can vary quite far from other Data-related practices.

It was important for me to practice what I learn in projects, so I can see if I can appropriately recall the theory. Practice has been the greatest catalyst to master a topic for me in the past and I therefore value it in my learning paths a lot.

For this solo semester-project, I set out to be confident to say "I know how to approach this data analysis", i.e build a relevent knowledge base to be familiar and comfortable to take on Data Analysis in the future. Besides that, educating myself about stock finances was something I felt a genuine interest in. The projects main objective is to serve as a gate to exploring and understanding more of the dynamics of the stock market, its potential flaws. To be able to form a more informed opinion on financial topics as the real-estate crash foregoing the financial crisis in 2008/9 - or to simply _understand them_ - is eminently important for me to achieve with my efforts and therefore my target goal.

## Execution

Sitting down and preparing a semester plan was really helpful to keep track of the necessary steps to achieve my goals. I was able to see when I was lacking behind with my estimated timeline, which was also a great chance to reflect on what my priorities should be for the recent time.

#### Courses
For my education, I found DataCamp to be a great fit for this need, as the courses introduce theory and practice together. For the finance-focused courses, I used video material on YouTube to research open questions, e.g. mathematical functions for financial factors, that were left unexplained in the courses. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/) was also a great resource to re-visit terminologies and learn more around the scope.

I decided to do one pure Data Science course (Data Manipulation with Pandas). I then chose one additional course to guide me into the foundations of financial analysis which simulanteously explored more data visualization with _matplotlib_ or _seaborn_. (Introduction to Financial Concepts in Python). I then proceeded with two more Applied Finances courses which are listed further down below. 

The total list of courses I have taken:
* (100%) Data Manipulation with Pandas
* (100%) Introduction to Financial Concepts in Python
* (75%) Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in Python
* (30%) Intermediate Data Visualization with seaborn

_As some courses have partially the same topics, I skipped some of its content to avoid repetition._ 

#### Projects

After my time with studying courses, I proceeded to get my hands on guided projects to practice. I chose DataCamp projects for this and one own project as a synthesis of all my learnings from the courses. A summary of their goals these can be further gathered in the `projects/README.md`. They all revolve around the question of risk or investment value analysis.

I have found the two guided projects provided by DataCamp as insightful in their adressed topics, but found them to be a difficult source to learn further. Their approach of filling in the gaps is helpful to memorize the method names and common abbreviations for imported packages, but I am, based on my past experience of Software Engineering, convinced that the memorization of method names or arguments is not of dire importance and I will soon unmaster these again. I felt accomplished after finishing a project, but didn't feel a particular growth in my Data Science competencies. 

I therefore took the time to research and look further into the methods applicated, i.e. what should and can I do something with the `.agg` method of pandas DataFrames?

The projects were insightful regarding the financial education and I am happy I finished them. For example, the project on Sharpe Ratios gave me the insight into a common method to determine a simple risk-and-return comparison between two assets (i.e. is Facebook or Amazon a better investment at same risk?). This made me  curious to learn more about risk management and led me into starting a course on DataCamp on portfolio risk management in Python. I was able to utilize the projects as a great icebreaker into learning more of what I wanted to learn.

As a third project, I decided to start my own project with a common and simple scenario: Our friend wants to invest and would like to know which investment beares more return with the same risk. It is essentially an extension of the guided project on The Sharpe Ratio (see above). I decided to approach this project as a chance to fully revisit my learnings without peeking into the slides/courses and perform a risk analysis. I also set myself a focus on using a lot of different visualizations to practice and implement `seaborn` visuals.

### A reflective look back

I am really happy with the preliminary outcome of my own project, as I felt confident and motivated to explain my steps. Furthermore, I am very surprised and happy how well I picked up the data visualization with seaborn. It required me a few Google searches to find out how to e.g. draw a horizontal x-line. The Learning Unit on Statistics & Probabilities and the data visualization course gave me an understanding on _when_ and _how_ to use a type of plot. My approach to apply & practice proved to me that I picked up data visualizations well and I am confident to implement it in the future.

The guided project used complex and unexplained models towards the end and I have found this to be very disencouraging. I couldn't find my entry into fully understanding what happened here nor how I could assess a need for such model in my own future projects. I definitely felt pulled too much out of my comfort zone to be able to understand it in my session. I have not revisited that chapter yet, mostly due to the uncertainty if it's relevant to me.  I am okay with that, though, as I learned a lot of other things during those days.

Generally, I am very content with my projects as I discovered that I understood fundamental concepts and gained relevant skills in data manipulation and visualization. To regard to my study progress in the frame of the module, I am positive about my knowledge in data handling and exploration. In my personal unguided project, I try to practice the communication of results and critical framing of findings. As I have not fully finished my unguided project yet, I have not come to a realization whether I succeeded with this well or not. I am positive about my current progress with my communication skills, though.

For the future, I strive to work on more projects with a need for complex data visualization and a strong need for effective communication. Stating hypotheses is something I'd like to practice more, too.
